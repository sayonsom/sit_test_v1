# HVVL LMS UAT Local-Server Deployment

This deployment path runs the complete UAT stack on the server:

- `virtuallab`: React/nginx frontend
- `lti-backend`: Brightspace LTI and staff OIDC session service
- `backend-api`: local FastAPI course/results API
- `postgres`: local PostgreSQL database
- `redis`: local session store

The frontend keeps `REACT_APP_API_URL=/api/v1`; nginx proxies that path to the
local `backend-api` container. This UAT path does not use the old Cloud Run API.

## 1. Pull The Shipped Repo

On the UAT server:

```sh
cd /opt/sit_test_v1

# Preserve the server-owned secret file before pulling the release that stops
# tracking .env.uat.
install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.config/hvvl"
if [ -f .env.uat ]; then
  install -m 600 .env.uat "$HOME/.config/hvvl/.env.uat"
fi

git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main

if [ -f "$HOME/.config/hvvl/.env.uat" ]; then
  install -m 600 "$HOME/.config/hvvl/.env.uat" .env.uat
fi
```

If deploying a security-fix branch before merge, check out that branch instead.

## 2. Create Or Update `.env.uat`

Keep this file out of git. The repository contains only `.env.uat.example`.

```sh
test -f .env.uat || cp .env.uat.example .env.uat
chmod 600 .env.uat
```

Replace every angle-bracket value in `.env.uat`. The Compose release is pinned
to disabled API docs and debug routes, so those switches are not accepted from
the environment.

`CLIENT_ID` and `DEPLOYMENT_ID` are the public registration identifiers shown
in the SIT Brightspace LTI 1.3 tool registration. They are not random secrets.
The values must match the registration that launches this UAT tool. If the
registration has more than one accepted client or deployment, put the complete
comma-separated allow-list in `LTI_CLIENT_IDS` or `LTI_DEPLOYMENT_IDS`.

`REACT_APP_AAD_CLIENT_ID` is also a public registration identifier, but it must
come from the SIT ADFS/OIDC application registration. It must not be generated
randomly. The Compose readiness gate requires both the client ID and authority
because staff sign-in is part of this deployment.

The Brightspace registration must use these exact UAT endpoints:

- OIDC login initiation URL: `https://hvlabonline-uat.singaporetech.edu.sg/lti/login`
- Redirect/launch URL: `https://hvlabonline-uat.singaporetech.edu.sg/lti/launch`
- OpenID Connect issuer: `https://xsitestg.singaporetech.edu.sg`
- Brightspace JWKS URL: `https://xsitestg.singaporetech.edu.sg/d2l/.well-known/jwks`

Generate separate random values for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
`BACKEND_API_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `BACKEND_API_JWT_SECRET`, and
`LOCAL_STORAGE_SIGNING_KEY` on the UAT server with:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Do not reuse the service token, JWT secret, or storage signing key. Readiness
requires the database password to be at least 16 characters and each of the
other three values to be at least 32 characters. It rejects placeholders and
reused signing values.

`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` must contain at least 16 characters. The official
PostgreSQL image applies that variable only when a data volume is first
initialised. Changing `.env.uat` alone does **not** change the login password
inside an existing volume. Use the data-preserving rotation command in the next
section when upgrading a volume that was created with a legacy short password.

## 3. Deploy The Local Stack

Use the guarded deployment script instead of running the individual Compose
build/start commands. It validates the environment before doing any build,
checks that an existing database volume accepts the configured password, waits
for all five services, and automatically prints the redacted Docker health
reason if startup fails. A password mismatch stops before the expensive image
build and directs the operator to the explicit rotation mode:

```sh
sudo python3 scripts/deploy_uat_stack.py .env.uat
```

For an existing PostgreSQL volume that still uses the legacy short password:

1. Generate a new password with `openssl rand -base64 48`.
2. Put that value in `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env.uat`.
3. Run the deployment once with the explicit rotation flag:

```sh
sudo python3 scripts/deploy_uat_stack.py .env.uat --rotate-postgres-password
```

The rotation runs `ALTER ROLE` over the PostgreSQL container's local socket,
verifies the new password over TCP, and never deletes or reinitialises
`postgres_data`. It does not print the password or put it on a subprocess
command line. Subsequent releases use the normal command without the rotation
flag.

This release changes the frontend, `backend-api`, and `lti-backend`; all three
images must be rebuilt. PostgreSQL and Redis data volumes must be retained.
Existing in-flight LTI state expires within five minutes, so users should start
a fresh Brightspace launch after deployment.

This release replaces session tokens in browser URLs with one-time login codes.
Old in-flight launch URLs cannot be resumed after deployment; start a new launch
from Brightspace.

Staff listed in `STAFF_ADMIN_EMAILS` must log out and sign in again after deployment so their refreshed `vhvl_api_token` includes the `admin` role.

Approved ADFS teachers receive only the course scopes listed in
`STAFF_COURSE_IDS` (comma-separated internal course IDs). The bundled HVVL
course is ID `2`; keep this list explicit so teacher score access remains
course-scoped rather than granting global administrator access. Teachers must
log out and sign in again after this value changes so the refreshed API token
contains the updated scope.

## 4. Apply DB Hardening To Existing Volumes

For a fresh `postgres_data` volume, the base schema and seed data are loaded by
the Postgres image. For an existing UAT volume, apply the additive hardening
migration after taking a backup:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.uat -f docker-compose.uat.yml exec -T postgres \
  sh -c 'pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" "$POSTGRES_DB"' \
  > "uat-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql"

docker compose --env-file .env.uat -f docker-compose.uat.yml exec -T postgres \
  sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"' \
  < backend-api/sql/2026-06-09-rbac-security-hardening.sql
```

Review any duplicate/null preflight output before enabling stricter unique or
not-null constraints that are intentionally left commented in the migration.

## 5. Smoke Test

```sh
sh scripts/verify-deployed-vapt-controls.sh \
  https://hvlabonline-uat.singaporetech.edu.sg
```

Expected unauthenticated responses:

- `/health`: `200`
- `/lti/health/ready`: `200` with `{"status":"ready"}`
- `/api/v1/auth/me`: `401`
- `/api/v1/students/`: `401`
- `/api/v1/generate-signed-url/`: `401`

If readiness is `503`, inspect only the named failed checks and correct
`.env.uat`; do not replace Brightspace IDs with random values:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_uat_environment.py .env.uat

docker inspect --format '{{range .State.Health.Log}}{{println .Output}}{{end}}' \
  "$(docker compose --env-file .env.uat -f docker-compose.uat.yml ps -q backend-api)"

docker compose --env-file .env.uat -f docker-compose.uat.yml logs --tail=200 backend-api
docker compose --env-file .env.uat -f docker-compose.uat.yml logs --tail=200 lti-backend
```

The health output and preflight intentionally omit configured values. Never
paste `.env.uat` itself into Jira, email, chat, or a support ticket.

If the health output is `failed_checks:["database_password"]` while the API log
shows `Postgres is up`, the configured password is accepted by PostgreSQL but
is shorter than the VAPT minimum. Do not weaken the readiness check or restore
the legacy password; perform the one-time data-preserving rotation described in
Section 3.

Then launch the tool from `D2L Training SandBox14 (VHVL Test)`. A direct browser
visit to `/lti/launch` is not a valid test because Brightspace must supply the
signed ID token and one-time state.

## 6. Edge Configuration

The platform team must configure Cloudflare or any upstream caching layer to
bypass cache for the exact path `/env-config.js`, then purge any previously
cached object for that path. The application sends `Cache-Control`,
`CDN-Cache-Control`, `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control`, and `Surrogate-Control`
no-store directives, but the edge rule must not override them.
Cloudflare consumes its service-specific header instead of forwarding it to
the browser; the public verifier therefore checks the forwarded
`CDN-Cache-Control` directive and requires `cf-cache-status` not to be `HIT`.

Cloudflare and AWS load-balancer cookies are platform-managed. Record their
owner, purpose, lifetime, domain/path, and supported flags in the platform
cookie register. Disable load-balancer stickiness when it is not required;
otherwise document the provider-controlled attributes and approved exception.

## 7. Rerun Retest

```sh
python3 scripts/hvvl_vapt_retest.py \
  --api-base https://hvlabonline-uat.singaporetech.edu.sg/api/v1 \
  --uat-url https://hvlabonline-uat.singaporetech.edu.sg/ \
  --out output/evidence/retest-uat-local-post-deploy \
  --include-auth-gate-posts
```
